        Chronicle
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I wrote a web app to help me track how I spend my time. It uses the
      Django framework for the back-end and Bootstrap for styling the
      front-end. It was my largest web development project to date, and I
      learned a ton from it.

      <a href="https://github.com/rgambee/self-correction-reproduction">
        AI Alignment Research
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      To learn about the process of doing empirical AI alignment research, I
      attempted to reproduce the paper
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07459.pdf">
        "The Capacity for Moral Self-Correction in Large Language Models"
      </a>
      by Ganguli et al. from 2023.

      <a href="./scraper.html">
        AI-Powered Web Scraper
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I build an AI-powered web scraper for a non-profit who focuses on AI
      safety. It automatically collects information about upcoming events,
      letting them keep their community up to date while saving them time.

        Undergraduate Capstone

    <p>
      As an undergrad, I worked with a team on two capstone engineering
      projects for outside clients. One was building a flight data recorder for
      SpaceX, and the other was studying the ferroelectric properties of
      nanoparticles.

      Formlabs, my employer, holds an annual hackathon for its employees. I've
      participated in every one and had a blast each time. Here are a couple of
      my most successful projects.

        Advent of Code

    <p>
      Advent of Code is a programming challenge held every year in December.
      I've participated in it several times, using it as an opportunity to
      teach myself new programming languages.
