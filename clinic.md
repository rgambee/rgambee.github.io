# Clinic Projects

At Harvey Mudd College, the Clinic Program serves as the capstone project for engineering majors. Teams of typically five students work for an academic year to solve a problem for an outside company. The program gives students experience with real-world issues and can sometimes lead to job offers from the project sponsors.

## SpaceX Clinic Project (2014-2015)

### Motivation
SpaceX relies heavily on data gathered during its rocket flights, both successful and otherwise, to inform future launches. While some of this information can be streamed via telemetry, there is far more data than available bandwidth. SpaceX therefore asked us to design, build and test a recoverable data recorder that would be analogous to a black box in the aviation industry. The device needed to
1. Receive and record data via Ethernet during rocket flight
2. Survive the extreme conditions of ascent, separation, and reentry
3. Be easily recoverable even in the event of a catastrophic failure.

### My Role
I focused on designing the recorder's housing, from selecting materials to simulating design alternatives to testing prototypes. Since the conditions of a rocket explosion are largely unknown, determining appropriate test procedures proved to be somewhat of a challenge. We were able to draw from SpaceX and Air Force protocols for vibration and temperature cycling during nominal flights. However, we needed to be a bit more creative when it came to destructive testing of mission failure scenarios. Test protocols for black boxes used in the aviation industry offered some guidance, though we had to make compromises due to our limited testing resources and number of prototypes.

### Results
Throughout the project, we used computer simulations to validate our designs, running vibration and thermal models to evaluate performance during nominal flight conditions. Our circuit board's dimensions and mounting scheme, plus the placement of its components, were selected to maximize its natural frequency and avoid resonance. We also added a heatsink to the housing to lower the microprocessor's operating temperature as it continuously processed the large amounts of data it received.

Later, we performed destructive testing on our late-stage prototypes to approximate mission failure scenarios. One unit was blowtorched to simulate atmospheric reentry and then hit with a sledgehammer to simulate impact with the ground or ocean. Amazingly, the microSD card inside was totally unscathed, and all of its data remained intact!
