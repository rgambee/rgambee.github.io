# Clinic Projects

At Harvey Mudd College, the Clinic Program serves as the capstone project for engineering majors. Teams of typically five students work for an academic year to solve a problem for an outside company. The program gives students experience with real-world issues and can sometimes lead to job offers from the project sponsors.
