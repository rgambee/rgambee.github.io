# Welcome
Hi, there! I'm Robert, a general engineer with a diverse set of interests, including chemical, materials and software engineering. I love working on interdisciplinary projects and am always eager to tackle a fresh challenge, while learning something new in the process.

Since 2015, I've been working as a Print Process engineer at Formlabs, a 3D printing company located in Somerville, MA. Before that, I attended Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA, where I received a B.S. in Engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, gaming and honing my programming skills.

Want to learn more about me? Check out my [Background](/background.md). Interested in the projects I've worked on? Have a look at my [Clinic](/clinic.md) and [Research](/research.md) experience.
