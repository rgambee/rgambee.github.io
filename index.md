# Welcome

Hi, there! I'm Robert, a software engineer with several years of experience in embedded
and web development, as well as data analysis and visualization. Outside of software, I
like to dabble in materials, electrical and mechanical engineering. I love working on
interdisciplinary projects and am always eager to tackle a fresh challenge, while
learning something new in the process.

Since 2015, I've been working as an engineer at Formlabs, a 3D printing company
located in Somerville, MA. Before that, I attended Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA,
where I earned a B.S. in Engineering.
