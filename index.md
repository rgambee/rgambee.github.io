# Welcome

Hi, there! I'm Robert, a software engineer with several years of experience in embedded
and web development, as well as data analysis and visualization. Outside of software, I
like to dabble in materials, electrical and mechanical engineering. I love working on
interdisciplinary projects and am always eager to tackle a fresh challenge, while
learning something new in the process.

Since 2015, I've been working as an engineer at Formlabs, a 3D printing company
located in Somerville, MA. Before that, I attended Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA,
where I earned a B.S. in Engineering.

    </h2>
    <p>
      I wrote a web app to help me track how I spend my time. It uses the
      Django framework for the back-end and Bootstrap for styling the
      front-end. It was my largest web development project to date, and I
      learned a ton from it.

    <p>
      To learn about the process of doing empirical AI alignment research, I
      attempted to reproduce the paper
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07459.pdf">
        "The Capacity for Moral Self-Correction in Large Language Models"
      </a>
      by Ganguli et al. from 2023.
