# Education

## Undergraduate

I graduated from [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/) in 2015 with a
B.S. in Engineering. Harvey Mudd's engineering degree is a general one,
covering everything from mechanical to electrical to materials engineering.
This allowed me to build a broad knowledge base across different disciplines.
While there, I was inducted into [Tau Beta Pi](http://tbp.org/home.cfm), the
national engineering honor society, and earned a mark of High Distinction on my
diploma.
