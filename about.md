# Background

## Education
I graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 2015 with a B.S. in Engineering. Harvey Mudd's engineering degree is a general one, covering everything from mechanical to electrical to materials engineering. This allowed me to build a broad knowledge base across different disciplines. While there, I was inducted into Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society, and earned a mark of High Distinction on my diploma.

## Professional Experience

### Formlabs: Print Process Engineer: 2015 to Present
Based in Somerville, MA, Formlabs designs professional-grade 3D printers. Unlike most 3D printers which extrude filament through a heated nozzle (fused deposition modeling or FDM), Formlabs printers use a laser to solidify either liquid resin, in an approach known as stereolithography (SLA), or nylon particles, in an approach known as selective laser sintering (SLS), into complex objects. These laser-based techniques can provide better surface finish, finer detail and superior mechanical properties compared to FDM. We were the first to bring stereolithography to the desktop with the Form 1, and its successor, the Form 2, is the best-selling stereolithography printer of all time.

I work on the Print Process team, which operates at the intersection of hardware, software and materials. Our goal is to understand the inner workings of the printing process, from the path that the laser traces, to the curing reaction of the resin, to the motion of the printer's motors. Based on this knowledge, we then work to optimize the printer's capabilities by increasing quality, reliability and speed. Print Process is a highly interdisciplinary team; we collaborate with the mechanical engineers to inform and test new designs, coordinate with the software team to release updates that improve printer performance, and work alongside the materials team resolve issues with new resin formulations.
