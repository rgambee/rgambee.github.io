# Hackathons

Formlabs holds an annual hackathon for its employees where individuals or small
groups work on a project of their choosing for two to three days. For my first
hackathon, I worked with three others to convert one of our 3D printers, which
utilize a technique known as inverted stereololithograpy, into a noninverted
printer. I helped with calibration and generating the instructions for the
printer. We managed to get our first print started in under 24 hours! It was
fun to squeeze as much of a product cycle as we could into only a few days.

The hackathon project I'm most proud of was the one I did in 2021, which was my
only solo project. I created a dashboard for viewing live sensor data and
status information from our 3D printers in a web browser. It involved both
embedded and web development. The server running on the printer was written in
Go and streamed data to clients using WebSockets. Visualization on the client
end was done in JavaScript using [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/).
It took a lot of work, but I managed to complete all the features I wanted to.
The hardest part for me by far was fiddling with the HTML and CSS to make it
look presentable. Unfortunately, I can't share the code or screenshots since
they have proprietary information.
